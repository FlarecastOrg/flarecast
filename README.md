# ðŸš€ Flarecast AI

**Flarecast** is an AI-powered geospatial platform that helps operators decide:
- âœ… Where to deploy flare-gas-powered compute infrastructure
- âœ… Whether to run Bitcoin mining or AI inference at each site
- âœ… How much COâ‚‚e they can offset â€” aligning with the FLARE Act

Built in under 6 hours for the MARA Hackathon.

## ðŸ—º Features
- Interactive map of real + mock flare gas sites
- Profit simulation: BTC vs AI inference
- Deployment difficulty scoring (lead time, land access, etc.)
- COâ‚‚ emissions avoided calculator
- FLARE Act compliance indicator
- **ðŸ¤– AI Assistant** with Google Gemini integration (pre-configured!)

## ðŸ¤– AI Integration

The dashboard now includes an AI assistant powered by **Google Gemini** that can:

- **Analyze flare gas sites** for viability and profitability
- **Provide market insights** based on current data
- **Recommend deployment strategies** (Bitcoin mining vs AI inference)
- **Calculate environmental impact** and regulatory compliance

### API Options

1. **Google Gemini API** (Default - âœ… Configured)
   - Your API key is already integrated
   - High-quality responses from Google's latest AI model
   - Fast and reliable

2. **Hugging Face Inference API** (Alternative)
   - Free tier available
   - Multiple model options
   - Requires API key setup

3. **Ollama** (Local - Completely Free)
   - Runs locally on your machine
   - No API limits
   - Privacy-focused

### Usage Examples

Ask the AI assistant questions like:
- "Which site has the highest profit potential?"
- "What are the current trends in Bitcoin mining?"
- "How do energy costs affect AI inference decisions?"
- "What factors should I consider for deployment?"
